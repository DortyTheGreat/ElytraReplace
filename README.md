# ElytraReplace

Meteor addon for automatic elytra replacement

### Download

1.21.4 download in awailable in [Releases](https://github.com/DortyTheGreat/ElytraReplace/releases/latest)

### Dependencies

Tested successfully with these mods, but other might work as well

- meteor-client-1.21.4-18.jar

### Usage

- Turn on the module, ensure that replace durability is high enough such that old elytra can be replaced mid-air

## Spaghetti

Meteor Client actually has ElytraReplace functionality, although it is limited to ElytraFly only. Which is a bit weird.
